This board is an embedded system based on the STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller. It incorporates an MPU9250 Inertial
Measurement Unit for angle estimation, an SPL06-007 barometer for altitude estimation and a TESEO-LIV3F GNSS receiver
for position estimation. There is also a second Radio Transceiver board (based on the nRF24L01+ transceiver) that is
connected as a shield to the Flight Controller board. You will find all the necessary PCB design files from Altium
and KiCad inside the respective folders. The firmware is not finished yet, but you will find most of the existing
files inside the 'Firmware' folder, including ST's HAL drivers generated by STM32CubeMX, an SPL06-007 driver, an
nRF24L01+ driver, a Kalman Filter implementation, as well as a PID Controller implementation. The MPU9250 driver, as
well as the main.c function are coming soon.
